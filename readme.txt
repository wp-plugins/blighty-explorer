Allows the complete file structure of a folder in Dropbox to be shared and navigated within a Wordpress page or post. Also allows for file uploads.

== Description ==
Allows the complete file structure of a folder in Dropbox to be shared within a Wordpress page or post. The folder can then be navigated via the Wordpress site and files selected and downloaded. Changes in the Dropbox folder, such as the addition or deletion of files, are reflected through to the Wordpress site.

File uploads to Dropbox are also supported.

== Installation ==
- Connect this plugin to your Dropbox account.
- This will create a subfolder called Blighty Explorer in your Apps folder within Dropbox.
- Place your folders and files you wish to share with the WordPress installation inside the Apps/Blighty Explorer subfolder.
- Use the shortcode [bex_folder] in your post or page to display a folder structure / file navigator.
- Use the shortcode [bex_upload] in your post or page to display a file upload dialog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use share two different folders from the same Dropbox account on two different installations? =
Yes. Structure your Apps/Blighty Explorer folder in Dropbox to have two subfolders. Change the root folder in the settings page on each installation to the subfolder you want to share.

= I like the icons in the file explorer. Can I use them in my software? =
With version 1.3.0, I implemented several icons from the wonderful Silk Icon set by [famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/). They are used under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

= I've upgraded from Version 1.2.1 or earlier. Do I still need the WP SVG Icons plugin? =
WP SVG Icons provides an easy to implement selection of icons that this plugin used to use in previous versions. It is no longer required and, if you have no other need for it, can be deactivated and deleted. The current version of the Blighty Explorer plugin will detect the presence of WP SVG Icons and prompt you to uninstall it. You can dismiss this prompt if you like.

= Can I use both [bex_folder] and [bex_upload] on the same page? =
Absolutely! The plugin is smart enough to tie the two together. For best results, place the shortcodes side by side: [bex_folder][bex_upload]

= Where has the admin menu gone? =
With version 1.5.1, you'll find them under the Settings menu.

= It seems my pop-up blocker is stopping file downloads. =
Prior to version 1.5.1, there may have been problems with certain browsers and/or pop-up blockers. Hopefully this has been resolved with v1.5.1. If you're still having problems, please open a support ticket stating browser and anything else that may help, and I'll take a look to resolve it.

= I want to only allow logged-in WordPress users or users with certain roles access to using the plugin. How do I do that? =
Use a plugin such as [User Specific Content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-specific-content/) in conjunction with this one in order to protect the page.
